# Hand-Tracking-To-Control-Music-and-Games
I trained the computer to detect and track my hand using Haar Cascade and Adaboost then I applied the tracking to control the mouse, music and car racing games.

To run the mouse controlling, please run the python file [here](https://github.com/mtruongn93/Hand-Tracking-To-Control-Music-and-Games/tree/master/mouse_control)

To run the music controlling, please run the python file [here](https://github.com/mtruongn93/Hand-Tracking-To-Control-Music-and-Games/tree/master/vlc_control)

To run the car racing games controlling, please run the python file [here](https://github.com/mtruongn93/Hand-Tracking-To-Control-Music-and-Games/tree/master/game_control)

This is best for you to run those files in a bright environment. This may not work on all hands since I only trained on 1 type of hand.
